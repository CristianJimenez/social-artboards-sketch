# Artboard presets for social media images
This is a Plugin for [Sketch App](http://www.sketchapp.com) that adds artboard presets for the most common image dimensions of
different social media platforms.

## Installation
Download or clone this package into to your Sketch3 Plugin Folder. The path should resemble the following
```~/Library/Application Support/com.bohemiancoding.sketch3/Plugins/social-artboards-sketch``` You need to manually start an installation routine (once) within the Sketch App itself. Either goto the Plugins Menu and select Social Artboards -> Install Social Artboards or use Keyboard shortcut
```Alt + Crtl + I```. Afterwards you will find a new Group called ```Social``` whenever you select to create a new Artboard or press the "A" key in the right column of your App.

## What's inside
A couple of useful [Artboard Presets](http://www.sketchapp.com/support/documentation/09-grouping/2-artboards.html) for Sketch App (Version 3) for common social media platforms.

### Social media images?!
Profile, cover, header + supplementary image sizes for the platforms like:

 - Twitter
 - Facebook
 - Google+
 - LinkedIn
 - Pintrest
 - Instagram
 - Youtube

### That's all folks
This is my first Sketch Plugin, so please feel free to [contact me](http://bit.ly/1MSRFbd) via twitter for comments, suggestions and critique. You can fork and contribute to the code and extend this package - I will happily merge any tested PRs.
